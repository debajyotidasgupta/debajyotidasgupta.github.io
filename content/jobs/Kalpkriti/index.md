- During this internship I worked on building a recommendation system using machine learning and the <a href="https://github.com/lyst/lightfm" target="_blank">LightFM Framework</a> provided by <a href="">Lyst</a>. The recommendaion sysem will give suggesions to users of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kk.tweencraft" target="_blank">Tweencraft</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kk.tweencraft" target="_blank">Animation App</a>. The problem of coldstart was handled by making use of a hybrid app.

- I had also built <a href="">REST APIs</a> using <a href="">NodeJS</a> in the backend and <a href="">MongoDB</a> for accessing data. These APIs were used to integrate the recommendation model with the application.

- Built complex queries using <a href="">SQL</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery" target="_blank">BigQuery (on GCP)</a> to fetch meaningful data and make interactive visualizatiions with <a href="">Google Data Studio</a> so tha actionable business decisions can be made on that.
