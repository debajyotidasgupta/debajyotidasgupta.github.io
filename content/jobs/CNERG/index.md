- Building a deep learning model and training it using <a href="">meta learning algorithms</a> to observe whether we can build a model that is efficient enough to solve puzzles only given the visual puzzle and he naural language rules given as a list. For this we start building model on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/">Abstraction and</a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/">Reasoning Challenge</a> hat was conducted on kaggle.

- Following this we will use the same idea to build a model for chatbot application, that will be learning on the fly and will be able learn about different domain speciific tasks from the recent context. Also when the chatbot fails it should be able to generate appropriate feedback question ha will help o improve is performance. For this we are making use of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/metalwoz/">MetaLWOz</a> dataset.
