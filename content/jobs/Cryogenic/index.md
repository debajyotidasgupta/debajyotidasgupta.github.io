- Build a Deep Learning based model using <a href="">Recurrent Neural Network</a> or/and <a href="">GRU/LSTM</a> for Digital Twin of the <a href="">Cryogenic Energy Storage System</a> integrated with a Matlab simulator.

- The above process required <a href="">exerimentation</a> wih various deep learning models and architecture and to make observation whether the model can make prediction successfully or not after only seeing <a href="">small amount of data</a> (few-shot) and without any prior domain knowledge.

- The model also <a href="">made decisions</a> and helped the operator to take <a href="">operational decision</a> on the plant for error free working of the energy storage system.
